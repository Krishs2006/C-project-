ATM Simulation Program (C Project)

This is a simple ATM simulation program written in C, developed as part of my coursework. It provides users with basic banking functions such as checking account balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money via a terminal-based menu system.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to reinforce the use of C functions, loops, and conditionals in a practical application. While it doesn't represent a full-scale banking system, it simulates how a basic ATM interface might operate behind the scenes.
